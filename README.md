# ABOUT DEWCLAW
"A DEWCLAW is an often-vestigial “non-weight bearing” toe on that appears just above the paw on cats, dogs and other mammals. When you search for the term on the web, hundreds of results are returned about the contentious discourse on Dewclaw removal; how the claw is attached, if it is ethical to remove it, the pain and complications that can come thereafter, as well as what to do if your pet’s extra claw is accidentally injured. 

SHAWNÉ MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY’s performance by the same name is a realtime multimedia composition that uses the choreography of common sadomasochist bondage play and the faux-rage fueled narrative vocalization styles of 1980 and 90’s wrestling promos, to consider old and forgotten memories, movements, habits, desires, and dreams we hold on to and assimilate into our bodies and identities. 


As much as an animal’s DEWCLAW might be a vestigial appendage, it is part of them, connected to the paw by flesh and collective history. What are our personal and collective histories that force us to carry the same vestigial signifiers? How do we emit or wear those invisible parts, long incorporated? To which part of our being are they attached? Are they difficult to remove? Do they pain us? What are the complications that come from their presence? What happens when our forgotten extras are accidentally called upon?

In DEWCLAW’s three parts, [LIGATURES], [TEAR], and [AMELIORATION], this three person performance mirrors the Internet’s discourse on declawing by scratching deep into stories about leaving heterosexuality behind, habits learned during intimacy with ex lovers, and shedding adolescence."

Isaac aka Cake is a leatherman of 12 years based out of Virginia. They teach classes on rough body play, tea service, and conflict resolution in Dominant/submissive relationships. They are deeply passionate about making the scene and BDSM in general more accessible to Black people and other POCs through their work with the 757 Spectrum Munch group, their time as a group leader for Richmond TNG, as well as through mentoring and writing.

Ms TNT Impact identifies as a masochistic bi femme leather girl who has been active in the kink community since 2016. During her journey, she has attended numerous BDSM conferences throughout the country. She is currently the Vice President of the Mid-Atlantic Onyx Pearls chapter, and has also served in the Memphis Project and the 757 Spectrum Munch, both based in Virginia. When she is not serving, she loves to play. Her kinks include cigar and ash play, rough body impact play, primal play, wax and knife play, and being bitten––with consent of course. She also has a passion for music and her new kink involves singing while involved in a scene.

Kitten is a non-binary transmasc Leatherboi active in the LGBTQ+, BDSM and Leather circles. They enjoy the local scene’s sense of intimacy and are dedicated to making space for support and inclusion among them through frequenting queer spaces and events as well as through their work with the Virginia Anti-Violence Project (VAVP.) In addition to their dedication to community, they are enamored by the art of being in service to others and love the hit shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel for their empowering portrayals of queerness. On the weekends, you can catch them fighting (or worshiping!) their own demons in the dungeon.

In 2010, Sun Splitter (2008-2015) closed out the farewell show of legendary Chicago DIY venue, The Mopery, drenched in fake blood.
